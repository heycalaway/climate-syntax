# Installation
With the terminal open, punch in the following:

```shell
apm install climate-syntax
```

# Languages
Expansive language support will take both time and the commutative efforts of others. Should you notice an unsupported language that you would like to be supported, your contributions are welcome (pending possible adjustments/approval).

# Brand
Enthused about the **Climate Atom Theme Suite**? How's about an icon to match!
